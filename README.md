# My small COBOL Project

Recently (late March 2017), I started learning COBOL programming just for fun.

It started off quite simply. As it happened, it was a discovery that COBOL has a feature for designing screen interfaces (layouts) by using SCREEN section. The following idea soon came to my mind: It seems that it is relatively and easily to create text-based applications like classical STAR-TREK game. Text-based applications has still importance for devices like Raspberry Pi with limited CPU power and memory because of its lightweight and fast nature, as compared with GUI-based applications, in my opinion. Besides, OpenCOBOL can be installed in a single line on Raspberry Pi with Raspbian. Only professionals can use COBOL on mainframe computers even now (maybe) but OpenCOBOL on Raspberry Pi is *"for the rest of us"*.

Different from a PC, one of the unique advantage about Raspberry Pi is the availability of GPIO pins. As a first step, I tried to write a small program to control GPIO pins in COBOL.
So far I do have very little knowledge about COBOL except for that it is a programming language with long history and it has been used for developing business applications, as its name implies (COmmon Business Oriented Language). As an electronics hobbyist, I am quite new to COBOL and therefore, COBOL Gurus can find many blemish points in my source code(s) but at least, it works.

I hope to add more piece of source codes to the repository as I learn more about COBOL,
as well as Raspberry Pi, and I would be glad if someone might find these codes useful.
